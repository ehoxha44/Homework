        <h4>Private life of Aarons</h4>
        
        <p>
            As at the time of writing, there might be a possibly hidden romance for Max, one which escapes the scrutiny of the public eye simply because his love life with his girlfriend is private and possibly drama-free.
            <br />
            Max has preferred to focus on his career and has sought to avoid any spotlight on his private life. This fact makes it difficult for us to have facts about his love life and dating history.
            <br />
            The secret of Max Aarons success comes from the fact that as an individual, he possesses an inner state of independence, one which enables him significant progress both in his <span>personal</span> and <span>professional</span> life.
